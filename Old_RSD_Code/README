This is a script that does the linear RSD computation. The input file for a galaxy survey is 
the same as for the BAO input files for the FoMSWG codes (see the ../Old_FoMSWG_Codes/ 
directory). It is still based on the WMAP 5-year cosmology; I need to update this before it 
gets used for the forecasting effort (hence the inclusion of 'Old' in the directory).

An example of how to use this is:

perl driver-rsd.pl < ../Old_FoMSWG_Codes/TEST/ref_bao.in

The BAO input files are of the form

38 0.04848 0.001
1.000   0.025   1.500   8.68E-04        0.500
...
2.850   0.028   2.425   4.08E-06        0.500

The format is:

First line: # z bins; fsky; sigma(z)/(1+z)

Each following line is for one z bin (so in this example there should be 38 following bins). The
format is: redshift z; full bin width delta z = zmax-zmin; galaxy bias b; number density n (in
Mpc^-3, **no h**); and reconstruction floor (usually 0.5, set to 1.0 to turn off reconstruction).
[Note that the actual amount of reconstruction is set by combining the floor with the linear theory
prediction for how well the displacements can be determined given the level of shot noise in the
data.]

The script prints to the screen:

1.000	0.025	1.500	8.68E-04	0.07976
...
2.850	0.028	2.425	4.08E-06	1.07094
#  6070.1

where the last column is sigma(f*sigma8)/(f*sigma8). In its present form this goes to kmax = 
0.2h/Mpc, with FoG length marginalization, fixed background cosmology, and no multi-tracer 
capability. The final number (6070.1) is the aggregate inverse variance on f*sigma_8.

The WMAP5 power spectrum used in this script was computed by CLASS (Blas et al. 2011).
