=== Introduction ===

This directory contains some old codes from the 2008 FoMSWG (which actually trace back to the ADEPT 
study from ~2006). These have been maintained by C. Hirata but some pieces have not been kept 
up-to-date and I haven't attempted to document this (I keep thinking the code will be obsolete 
before I get around to this!); please ask before using what looks like a feature.

You should run make test to create the executables wl-fisher.x and bao-fisher.x. The settings in 
test.c right now have the systematics turned off, but we can run cases with selected systematics 
turned on by varying the flags used in the main function to call the Fisher routines, and in some 
cases by modifying the input files. (You will get some unused variable warnings.)

The recommended 'first test cases' are

./bao-fisher.x TEST/ref_bao.in TEST/ref_bao.out
./wl-fisher.x TEST/ref_wl_trunc.in TEST/ref_wl_trunc.out

and you can see whether the outputs are consistent with TEST/ref_bao.out_cmh and 
TEST/ref_wl_trunc.out_cmh. Note that the BAO case is very fast but the WL case has a huge 
covariance matrix inversion and takes a while (~35 minutes on my laptop). The outputs are FoMSWG 
format matrices (Albrecht et al. 2009).

The files nr_utils.* are (slight modifications of) the public domain Numerical Recipes codes. The 
repository does not contain any copyrighted code.

=== BAO ===

The BAO input files are of the form

38 0.04848 0.001
1.000   0.025   1.500   8.68E-04        0.500
...
2.850   0.028   2.425   4.08E-06        0.500

The format is:

First line: # z bins; fsky; sigma(z)/(1+z)

Each following line is for one z bin (so in this example there should be 38 following bins). The 
format is: redshift z; full bin width delta z = zmax-zmin; galaxy bias b; number density n (in 
Mpc^-3, **no h**); and reconstruction floor (usually 0.5, set to 1.0 to turn off reconstruction). 
[Note that the actual amount of reconstruction is set by combining the floor with the linear theory 
prediction for how well the displacements can be determined given the level of shot noise in the 
data.]

The code prints to the terminal a table of results:

1.000  4.37294e+08  4.83232e+00 0.040531 0.081149  0.40858 0.028733
...
2.850  7.13765e+08  1.73254e-02 0.908071 1.211188  0.41518 0.558912

Here the columns are: z; the volume V in that redshift slice (in Mpc^3, **no h**); nP at 
k=0.2h/Mpc,mu=0 (note this is *with h* for consistency with common convention); sigma(D)/D; 
sigma(H)/H; the correlation coefficient of D and H (usually ~0.4 for galaxies); and sigma(s)/s 
(total scale, i.e. best constrained combination of D and 1/H).

=== Weak Lensing ===

The weak lensing input files are of the form

15 12 12.68 0.475 0.04848
0.10	1.643E-09	1.00E-05	1.00E-05
...
2.90	3.047E-08	1.00E-05	1.00E-05

The format is:

First line: # z bins; # l bins; first l; delta ln l; fsky

Each following line is for one z bin (so in this example there should be 15 following bins). The 
format is: z_src for that bin; noise (sigma_gamma^2/nbar, in units of sr^-1); mean photo-z 
uncertainty in that bin; shear calibration uncertainty in that bin.

There are a few options for intrinsic alignment marginalization in the get_wl_fisher function.
